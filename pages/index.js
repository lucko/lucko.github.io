      <h1>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>
        I'm <b>lucko</b> (or sometimes I use the nickname "Luck").
        <br />
        I'm a software developer from London, UK.
      </p>
      <p>This is a personal website and domain that I use for the various open-source projects I work on.</p>
      <p>
        If you'd like to contact me, you can find how to reach me on my <Link href="/contact">contact page</Link>.
        <br />
        You can also find me on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/lucko">@lucko</a>.

      <p>A number of other sites and services are available under this domain.</p>

      <h1>My projects</h1>
      <p>I work on a number of open source projects in my spare time.</p>

      <Project repo="lucko/LuckPerms">
        <li>LuckPerms is a <b>permissions</b> management system for Minecraft servers.</li>
        <li>At time of writing, it's been downloaded ~7M times, has ~400,000 monthly active users,
          and a Discord community of ~19,000 people.</li>
        <li>The project also has a website, <a href="https://github.com/lucko/LuckPermsWeb">LuckPermsWeb</a>,
          which includes web apps for viewing/editing/managing permission setups, written using Vue.js.</li>
        <li>More information can be found on the project homepage at <a href="https://luckperms.net/">luckperms.net</a>.</li>
      </Project>

      <Project repo="lucko/spark">
        <li>spark is a <b>performance profiler</b> for Minecraft clients, servers and proxies.</li>
        <li>At time of writing, it's been downloaded ~25M times and has ~20,000 monthly active users.</li>
        <li>The project also has a website, <a href="https://github.com/lucko/spark-viewer">spark-viewer</a>,

        <li>More information can be found on the project homepage at <a href="https://spark.lucko.me/">spark.lucko.me</a>.</li>
      </Project>

      <Project repo="lucko/paste">
        <li>paste is a simple web app for writing & sharing code. It's my own take on conventional
          pastebin sites like pastebin.com or hastebin.</li>
        <li>The frontend is written using React, and based on the Monaco Editor.</li>
        <li>There is a public instance I host at <a href="https://pastes.dev/">pastes.dev</a>.</li>
      </Project>

      <Project repo="lucko/bytebin">
        <li>bytebin is a fast & lightweight <b>content storage</b> web service, written in Java.</li>
        <li>You can think of it a bit like a pastebin, except that it accepts any kind of
          data (not just plain text!)</li>
        <li>It has a straightforward HTTP API that supports CORS.</li>
      </Project>

      <Project repo="lucko/bytesocks">
        <li>bytesocks is a fast & lightweight <b>WebSocket server</b>, written in Java.</li>
        <li>It allows clients to create "channels", connect using the WebSocket protocol and
          exchange messages with other clients in the same channel.</li>
      </Project>

      <Project repo="lucko/helper">
        <li>helper is a <b>development toolkit / library</b> for Bukkit plugin developers. It provides a number of utilities
          and extended APIs which help to reduce boilerplate code and offer alternative paradigms for creating content.</li>
        <li>I'm no longer actively working on further API additions, but the project is still being used
          frequently by various development teams, and I accept pull requests!</li>
      </Project>
